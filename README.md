# Alexapi-Special-Needs-Assistant
An Alexa enabled home assistant designed for people with special needs that need reminders for certain tasks.

This is an extremely early version of the Alexa enabled personal assistant I've made for my daughter.  There are a lot of
features that I'd still like to add.  This is very much an early work in progress by a hobbyist.
