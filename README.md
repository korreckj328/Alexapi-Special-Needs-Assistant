# Alexapi-Special-Needs-Assistant
An Alexa enabled home assistant designed for people with special needs that need reminders for certain tasks.

I'd like to thank Ben Eagan over at http://www.cyber-omelette.com  His blog had the tutorial I used to understand how to send a command from an Alexa skill over to the Raspberry Pi with his post here.  http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/01/alexa-run-script.html

This is an extremely early version of the Alexa enabled personal assistant I've made for my daughter.  There are a lot of
features that I'd still like to add.  This is very much an early work in progress by a hobbyist.  For more information please check out the wiki.
