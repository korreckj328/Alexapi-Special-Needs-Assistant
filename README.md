# Alexapi-Special-Needs-Assistant
An Alexa enabled home assistant designed for people with special needs that need reminders for certain tasks.

I'd like to thank Ben Eagan over at http://www.cyber-omelette.com  His blog had the tutorial I used to understand how to send a command from an Alexa skill over to the Raspberry Pi with his post here.  http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/01/alexa-run-script.html

This is an extremely early version of the Alexa enabled personal assistant I've made for my daughter.  There are a lot of
features that I'd still like to add.  This is very much an early work in progress by a hobbyist.  For more information please check out the wiki.

Update 4/11/18
I'm actually in the middle of a long remake and rethink of this idea.  I'm working on getting everything running with a Google AIY Voice kit with Alexa,  and creating a full installer and setup program to simplify installation of everything for people that might need a device like this.  Hopefully by the end of summer I'll have something made up that will be much easier for someone to build and install.  (Hopefully I have enough free time)
